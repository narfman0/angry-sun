There are two (current) variants of our current practice ROM:

- fcoughlin created the standard version, which hard-codes debug mode (start screen lives and stage select, select button cycles powerups, full infinite world map items) and includes hammer brother delete and stage reentry. <https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqgl5k0qi9si5en/Super%20Mario%203%20Practice%20ROM.nes?dl=0>

- dotsarecool augmented fcoughlin's ROM and created a version that allows start-select stage exit and adds dots on the screen at P-speed check points. <http://www.dotsarecool.com/twitch/smb3pspeed.html>
