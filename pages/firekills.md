# [Firekill morton (assemble_me)](#firekill-morton-assemble_me)

Assemble wrote a spreadsheet to further detail morton behavior: [src](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTgyb-gTH6rrxQI4_5KIJqMx6vrXKZRhKid6vg9a5XLYuf4e3VeI0qnpUuAI3jKjOc9ySScmPryQ6lf/pubhtml)

# [Firekill patterns [warpless] (teex)](#firekill-patterns-warpless-teex)

I (teex) made a playlist of pretty much all the boss patterns you'll typically encounter in Warpless. 

Each clip is comprised of:
- the firekill
- the pattern by itself (simply watching the boss's opening moves for recognition purposes
- screenshots & footage of any manipulations or conditional setups wherever applicable

# [Firekill patterns (TheHaxor)](#firekill-patterns-thehaxor)

I made a video explaining how boss patterns are determined in general and a
couple videos for the common W4 and W5 fire kills in warpless since I've had
some people asking me about it recently and there doesn't seem to be a great
resource that exists to my knowledge. I pretty much had to learn how to do
them from other people's VODs.

# [Lemmy fire kill (Horsedad / ilm)](#lemmy-fire-kill-horsedad--ilm)

On a unrelated note, ILM showed me this really cool Lemmy firekill today that
lets you avoid having to rely on bouncing off his back. It's slightly slower,
but far, far more consistent. To be clear, this is all ILM's creation.
