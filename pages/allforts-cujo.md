## Rules

Beat the game, completing every fortress in the game. Only the fortresses are required, not the castles/airships (other than Bowser’s Fort).

Time starts on pressing Start on the title screen.  
Time ends on entering the door after defeating Bowser, which is exactly 5 frames before the screen begins to fade.

## Notes

Any hammer bros not listed as kill or avoid are optional and are limited to stars and P-wings. You must collect at least 1 P-wing (for 6-5) and at least 1 star (for 7-2) from hammer bros at some point in Worlds 3-6. The last P-wing will help you get through 6-9 or 7-6 quickly, but this is technically optional. Even with the extra P-wing, you still have to choose between wall jumping 6-9 or zipping 7-6.

Note that the star HB in World 3 is optional since you don’t have to cross the bridge below 3-6.

Collecting the cloud in 3-7 allows you to skip any single level of your choice. 4-4 and 5-2 are the longest unskipped levels, and 3-9 is only 20 frames shorter than those, so skipping one of these 3 levels is recommended.

You get a music box at the end of W3. Use it any time you need to skip an extra HB.
