N-spade warpless route
----------------------

For warpless, we are allowed to spawn the n-spade card game over levels in order to play
the n-spade game and mark the level completed. In order to do this, we need to spawn
the game over a level, and there is a level in which this saves time in warpless: 3-6.
Some of the theory is covered in [mitchs youtube video, here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbrKENJZxc&pp=ygUYbWl0Y2hmbG93ZXJwb3dlciBuLXNwYWRl) and cujos pastbin, copied and linked on this site.

In order to get the card to spawn on 3-6 for warpless, we must do the following:

1. Fight a hammer brother to the left of 2-4 (either bro is fine, ideally hammer and skip box)
2. After HB left of 2-4, play the pyramid
3. After pyramid, play the airship
4. After airship, use hammer to destroy the block in world 3
5. After destroying the block, play the roulette game
6. After the roulette game, you will hear the nspade card spawn. Note, it coincides with the HB left of 2-4's x and y position on the map.
7. Play everything normally up to 3-6.
8. Ideally, we skip the star in all of world 3
9. Play the n-spade game. This is a good opportunity to pick up a fire flower or two, potentially for after 5-1 and after 6-9.
10. Play 3-7 (only if you skipped the star bro) and get cloud. This means we have two extra clouds: one unused from 3-6, and one we just collected
11. Play 4f1 :D we used the hammer in early world 3
12. Consider using pwing in 5-1 and equipping fire flower after 5-1
13. Consider walljumping 6-9 and equipping fire flower after
14. Consider clouding 7-9, 7f2, and 8f with your two extra clouds

Note: 3-7 collecting cloud is ~31s, 8F is ~41s, 7f2 is ~32s depending on your
route. 4-4 is another candidate cloud level if you have hammer for 7f2 (they
are very close timewise)

Note2: if you have to fight the w3 star, we need to line up with bridge, so
skip 3-7. It's a nasty timeloss but unavoidable :shrug:
