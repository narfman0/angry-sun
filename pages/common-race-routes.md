The following are basic routes for each of the specific goals.

Timing for all routes begins on hitting the Start button on the title screen to begin the game. 

# [100%](#100)

In a **Hundo**, racers must complete every stage in the entire game as fast as possible. The general expectation is that every stage is interacted with and somehow cleared.

### Rules & Restrictions

-   The player *must* clear *all 90 stages in the game*. (Numbered stages, non-numbered stages, fortresses, Hammer Brothers, Piranha Stages, and Hand Traps must all be finished.)
    -   Although Warp Whistles are not technically disallowed, using them will likely result in disqualifying circumstances; that is, the player could easily put themselves in a situation where they can no longer clear all 90 stages (a requirement for the run to be valid), so usage of whistles is discouraged.
    -   Using a Jugem's Cloud to skip stages or Music Boxes to skip Hammer Brothers is only permissible insofar as removing such items from the player's inventory; if the player chooses to do so, they must still go back and complete any initially-skipped action scenes before finishing the world.
    -   Although skipping stages entirely is not permitted, the player may still perform in-stage clips, as this does not completely skip all manner of interaction with the stage - the player is still interacting with the stage in a way that results in its proper completion (via card/orb collection).
    -   Clearing all stages implies that the player may *not* use the 7-1 wrong warp to go directly to the credits (since they must beat the game properly). However, the player *could* technically use the 7-1 wrong warp to go *elsewhere* in the game, but this has not yet been shown to save time (especially considering time spent setting up the glitch), and thus there is presently no known reason to do so.

Timing ends on entering the final door after defeating Bowser.

# [Any% Warpless](#any-warpless)

In a **Warpless**, racers must complete the game as fast as possible without using warps. The general expectation is that all 8 worlds are navigated through and cleared in some way.

### Rules & Restrictions

-   The player may *not* perform the wrong warp directly to the credits from 7-1.
-   One of the points of this category is that the player not use any Warp Whistles. However, rules regarding accidental Warp Whistle usage are notably different depending on whether the player is racing, or specifically shooting for leaderboard entry:
    -   If the player is racing, it is permissible to warp back to the world where they accidentally used the whistle, and resume from the start of that world.
    -   If the player is shooting for leaderboard entry, their run is disqualified by definition, and they must trash the attempt and start a new run.
-   The player must properly complete all 8 worlds, by somehow navigating to the castle, getting on the airship, and retrieving the wand from the koopaling boss, followed by clearing world 8 by getting to Bowser's Castle and defeating Bowser.
    -   Using Jugem's Clouds to skip stages is not only permitted, but encouraged, and the player may skip Hammer Brothers by using Music Boxes at their discretion.

Timing ends on entering the final door after defeating Bowser.

# [Any% No Wrong Warp](#any-no-wrong-warp)

In a **No Wrong Warp**, racers must complete the game as fast as possible without utilizing the game-breaking wrong warp present in 7-1. The general expectation is that proper, non-glitched warps will be used to expedite the process of beating the game as much as possible without breaking it.

### Rules & Restrictions

-   The player may *not* perform the wrong warp directly to the credits from 7-1.
-   The player *may and needs to* use Warp Whistles. (That's the whole point of this category.)

Essentially, this route utilizes two Warp Whistles acquired from 1-3 and 1-F to warp directly from world 1 to world 8, and then clearing world 8 properly by defeating Bowser; it can also be known as "Warps%," as it allows using Warp Whistles.

Timing ends on entering the final door after defeating Bowser.

# [Any%](#any)

In an **Any Percent**, racers must complete the game as fast as possible, by any means necessary. Major glitches are allowed.

### Rules & Restrictions

(None)

This basically means executing the wrong warp glitch in 7-1 to go directly to the Princess's chamber, effectively finishing the game in the lowest time possible. Bowser is never seen or fought in this run.

Timing ends on Mario becoming visible in the Princess's chamber.
