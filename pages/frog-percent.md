(Copied from Aweglib's [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/P7Yu3JEM))

This pastebin is to be used whenever there is a Frog% Race held on SRL. Hold any races in the smb3hacks game. 

### How does Frog% work?

There is a Game Genie (OUKXGLIE to be exact) that tells the game that Mario is always wearing a frog suit. Because of this, there is an added benefit/drawback (depending on how you want to look at it) that Mario is basically invincible. You can still fall off levels, be eaten by Big Bertha, or die to lava however.

For any Frog% runs/races, OUKXGLIE is required to be used, but all other Game Genie codes or other methods of altering the game are BANNED.

### What are the different categories that can be raced?

There are currently 3 categories that are raced: Frog%, Frog Any% and Frog 1-Warp%.

#### Frog%

Frog% is the original and easiest category. In Frog%, the goal is to beat Roy in World 5 without using any warp whistles.

It is useful to get 1 Hammer and 2 Clouds during the run in order to skip some autoscrollers and a long fortress. 1 cloud is given to you by Toadstool after World 2, and the other cloud can be obtained from the first Hammer Bro in World 4. There are two different hammers available, one in World 2, and one in World 3, it is your choice which one you want to get. The first cloud is used in World 3, you'll want to cloud over 3-6 when the bridge to 3-8 is down in order to skip a lot of the 2nd half of the world. The first hammer is used in World 4 to skip the first fortress. The second cloud is used in World 5 to skip 5-9 and go straight to the airship.

Timing ends when Mario grabs the wand to end World 5.

#### Frog Any%

Frog Any% aims to beat the game as quickly as possible. In order to do this, you'll need 2 clouds and 2 whistles.

The first whistle is obtained in the secret exit of 1-3, the other whistle is collected by beating the fire bros located past the block on the top right corner of World 2. You'll need to get the hammer from one of the hammer bros in World 2 to get to the fire bros. The first cloud is given to you by Toadstool after World 2, the other cloud can be obtained by finding the secret exit at the top of 3-7. After obtaining all these items, use the first warp whistle to go to the Warp Zone, and then use the second warp whistle in the Warp Zone to go to World 8. You'll need to use the clouds to skip 8-1 and 8-F1, as those levels cannot be beaten by Frog Mario. DO NOT DIE IN 8-2 OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE GAME.

Timing ends when you enter the door after beating Bowser.

#### Frog 1-Warp%

Frog 1-Warp% aims to beat as much of the regular path through the game, unfortunately the game cannot be beaten without warping as a frog, hence 1-Warp%.

In order to get through this category, you'll need 1 whistle, 4 clouds, and 2 hammers. The whistle is collected by beating the fire bros located past the block on the top right corner of World 2. You'll need to get the hammer from one of the hammer bros in World 2 to get to the fire bros. You'll get the first cloud from Toadstool after completing World 2. The second hammer is obtained in World 3 from one of the hammer bros. You'll also want to go to 3-7 to get the cloud from the secret exit there. In World 4, use your second hammer to skip past the first fortress. You'll collect the third cloud from one of the hammer brothers there. You'll get the final cloud that you need after completing World 5. After entering World 6, you should have 1 warp whistle and 4 clouds in your inventory. Warp to World 7. In World 7, you'll want to cloud past both of the fortresses, as those levels cannot be beaten by Frog Mario. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DIE AFTER SKIPPING THE FORTRESSES OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE GAME. In World 8, you'll need to use the clouds to skip 8-1 and 8-F1, as those levels cannot be beaten by Frog Mario. DO NOT DIE IN 8-2 OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE GAME.

Timing ends when you enter the door after beating Bowser.
