## ROMs

There are three (current) variants of our current practice ROM. Provided are

1. rom link - direct links to the rom or information about it
2. patch link - the IPS (binary) patch file based against the (common) PRG0 SMB3 .nes file.
Running [RomPatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) or [Lunar IPS](https://www.fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/)
to patch the PRG0 rom should yield the target practice rom.

### Current

- Lui has extended fcoughlin and dotsarecool's work. Included in the zip are
patches for regular practice, pspeed with dots, and a subpixel practice rom
patch for 7-1/7-6/7-7/7-9
  - [patch link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/patches/smb3practice_20220313.zip)

- Lui has created a firekill practice rom. Usage:
1. Go to the desired world
2. powerup before entering a level the distance from the castle you wish
3. press select to increment the leftmost number in score (which represents
how many movements the bro will take when exiting the level)
4. press select-start to exit the level
5. go to the airship as normal
You will get the pattern you selected with the 'select' button.

### Historical patches

- fcoughlin created the standard version, which hard-codes debug mode (start screen lives and stage select, select button cycles powerups, full infinite world map items) and includes hammer brother delete and stage reentry.

  - [patch link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/patches/Super Mario 3 Practice ROM.ips)

- dotsarecool augmented fcoughlin's ROM and created a version that allows start-select stage exit and adds dots on the screen at P-speed check points.

  - [patch link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/patches/smb3pspeed.ips)

- Lui's builds off dots' further. Description: not much new, but iâ€™ve replaced the anchor with something that looks like a poison shroom that makes you small mario on the map, also added some meme easter egg which may or may not be useful, see if you can figure it out

## Alternatives

### [SMB3 Race Edition](#smb3-race-edition)

MaCobra made a race edition, which is also a candidate for a future tournament rom.
It is speedrunners edition minus autoscroller edits, or, nohands + HB movements of one.
