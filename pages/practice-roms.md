## ROMs

There are three (current) variants of our current practice ROM. Provided are 1. rom link - direct links to the rom or information about it
and 2. patch link - the IPS (binary) patch file based against the (common) PRG0 SMB3 .nes file. Running Lunar IPS to patch the PRG0 rom
should yield the target practice rom.

- fcoughlin created the standard version, which hard-codes debug mode (start screen lives and stage select, select button cycles powerups, full infinite world map items) and includes hammer brother delete and stage reentry.

  - [patch link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/patches/Super Mario 3 Practice ROM.ips)

- dotsarecool augmented fcoughlin's ROM and created a version that allows start-select stage exit and adds dots on the screen at P-speed check points.

- Lui's builds off dots' further. Description: not much new, but iâ€™ve replaced the anchor with something that looks like a poison shroom that makes you small mario on the map, also added some meme easter egg which may or may not be useful, see if you can figure it out
