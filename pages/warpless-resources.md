### [Warpless Seminar by mitchflowerpower](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3gkkS4FY_-EwqsWUnhcjMLPXWBCqvIzg)

Mitch is currently working on putting together and in-depth talk of different strats for each stage. Still in progress, but the work done so far is incredible, definitely worth checking out regardless of your skill level.

### [Warpless Route by CujoIHSV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link pages/warpless-route-guide-cujo.md %})

Goes over basic theory, when and where to fight hammer bros and use items, etc.

### [Warpless Tutorial by WhenChukAttacks](https://www.twitch.tv/whenchukattacks/v/42569050)

Talks about basic movement in general as well as strats for levels, good source if you've gotten a little start with SMB3 or even if you're still brand new.

Another good tutorial, split up by worlds. Shows individual levels then breaks them down for visual cues, etc.

### Warpless Strategy by Aweglib:

[Part 1 Worlds 1-3](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/34984893)

[Part 2 Worlds 4-6](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/36519785)

[Part 3 Worlds 7-8](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/36520960)

I wanted to make more of a big picture kind of guide, geared more towards players who have already learned strats, but might be still struggling with remembering how to deal with RNG or mistakes during a run. How to do levels quickly is shown as just part of the overall discussion, but this is focused more on handling the route instead of individual level strats.

For roms/hacks/patches to preexisting roms (disable deaths, no card game, etc), and check Lui's practice rom for other features.

### Game Genie Codes for Console

KKKZSPIU YPXXLVGE AEUGNSSL

As far as I know these are the 3 best Game Genie codes to use if you want to practice on console. I don't know exactly which code is which, but it gives you access to a world select and life counter on the opening screen, (Up/Down to change world on the left, A to add on 5 more lives) gives you a full inventory with the ability to reuse items, as well as letting you re-enter normal stages. Forts, airships, and odd levels like the pyramid are unable to be re-enter after completion, so you'll have to suicide in the level or reset to get back into them.
 
### [SMB3 RTA Wiki](http://smb3rta.wikia.com/wiki/SMB3RTA_Wiki)
 
Slightly outdated, but still has some decent information. I might look into getting this more up-to-date as the days go on.
