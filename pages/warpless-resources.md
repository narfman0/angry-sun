Mitch is currently working on putting together and in-depth talk of different strats for each stage. Still in progress, but the work done so far is incredible, definitely worth checking out regardless of your skill level.

### [Warpless Tutorial by WhenChukAttacks](https://www.twitch.tv/whenchukattacks/v/42569050)

Talks about basic movement in general as well as strats for levels, good source if you've gotten a little start with SMB3 or even if you're still brand new.

Another good tutorial, split up by worlds. Shows individual levels then breaks them down for visual cues, etc.

### Warpless Strategy by Aweglib:

[Part 1 Worlds 1-3](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/34984893)

[Part 2 Worlds 4-6](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/36519785)

[Part 3 Worlds 7-8](http://www.twitch.tv/aweglib/v/36520960)

I wanted to make more of a big picture kind of guide, geared more towards players who have already learned strats, but might be still struggling with remembering how to deal with RNG or mistakes during a run. How to do levels quickly is shown as just part of the overall discussion, but this is focused more on handling the route instead of individual level strats.

For roms/hacks/patches to preexisting roms (disable deaths, no card game, etc), and check Lui's practice rom for other features.
