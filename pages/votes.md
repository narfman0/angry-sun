## [Enhanced eh manipulation tooling](#enhanced-eh-manipulation-tooling)

### Details (narfmans original post) [src](https://discord.com/channels/599131748143464459/599134097721524224/1075442241562226798)

narfman0: i've developed a method through which the runner can avoid delag strats in 1-1 and 1-5 by listening to a modified retrospy, which is the input display many retro gamers use in their layouts to show their inputs. this lets us count lag frames, so we can offset the eh action frames by however many lag frames we got. practically, we can save 4-5 seconds in 1-1 and 1-5, have a shot at a nohands manip, and others. this is a read-only tool and does not do anything for the runners. it only reads data passively and plays audio/visual cues on certain action frames...

[10:44 AM]narfman0: philosophically, for our leaderboards, i want to check with the community+mods before submitting any future run using this augmented tool. instead of being a glorified metronome, it now is reading live data inputs and making nontrivial timing decisions on the fly. while it is not modifying the console/controller, and is a read-only operation, it is a new gray area, and i appreciate folks' concerns. what are yalls thoughts? other pros or cons yall can think of? where do you land in support/opposition? thanks for your consideration :)

[10:45 AM]narfman0: note1: this would be possible without retrospy by reading video, but that method was taking excrutiatingly long to implement.

note2: as a user of the tool, it is more fun to run world 1 avoiding the delag strats. we can push the time lower and its more exciting, which is not an excuse to pollute or dull the leaderboards, but is a motivation as a runner and i suspect is more fun to watch/explain.

note3: for certain start frames, we can get fairly consistent amounts of lag frames , so if banned a future runner would probably just want to run that many more times in ignorance until they finally get the lag frames they expect and execute to take advantage of it.

note4: i want to hand wavily say it just saves time for high level runners, translating what was complete RNG to now be execution based well timed inputs. it does not do anything actively for the runner.

### Vote choices

Should we change the rules to ban enhanced eh manipulation tooling?

1. Application features that read data live (like but not limited to lag frames), which provide a benefit or stimulii to the runner (like but not limited to an audio cue or visual cue), after the run has started, in order to exploit the game via in-app calculations (like but not limited to reverse engineered game logic or rng calculations) are banned narfman0s 50:37, not on src, would be banned

2. All application features are allowed where they do not contradict the rules about modified consoles/games
